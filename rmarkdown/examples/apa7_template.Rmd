Reaction times are shown to change across lifespan [@blomkvist2017reference]. @blomkvist2017reference provided reaction time data for various ages. From these data we can test to what extent age-related changes are affected by smoking.

# Method

## Participants

```{r}
# Get age summary for in-text stats example
age_data <- select(blomkvist, id, age) %>% unique()
```

We analysed the data from `r nrow(age_data)` participants. The median age of the sample is `r median(age_data$age)` years with a *SD* of `r sd(age_data$age)` with a minimum of `r min(age_data$age)` and a maximum of `r max(age_data$age)` years of age.


```{r}
# Remove participants with extremely long average rts
rt_threshold <- 5000
removed <- blomkvist %>% 
  count(below_threshold = rt < rt_threshold) %>% 
  mutate(total = sum(n),
         perc = n / total * 100) %>% 
  filter(!below_threshold) %>% 
  select(n, perc)

blomkvist <- filter(blomkvist, rt < rt_threshold)
```

# Data analysis

Average response times larger than `r rt_threshold` msecs were removed from the analysis ($N=$ `r removed$n`, `r removed$perc`%). Reaction time changes over age are shown in Figure \ref{fig:rawdata}.


```{r rawdata, fig.pos='ht', fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'Raw reaction times with locally fitted functions.'}
ggplot(blomkvist, aes(y = rt, 
                      x = age, 
                      colour = smoker, 
                      fill = smoker,
                      linetype = smoker)) +
  geom_point(size = 1.5, alpha = .25) +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", 
              formula = y ~ poly(x, 2), 
              fullrange = TRUE, 
              size = .5,
              alpha = .25) +
  facet_grid(dominant ~ response_by) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  scale_fill_colorblind() +
  labs(colour = "Smoker", 
       fill = "Smoker", 
       linetype = "Smoker",
       y = "RT in msecs", 
       x = "Age")
```



```{r}
# Select only data for hand
blomkvist <- filter(blomkvist, response_by == "Hand") %>%
  select(-response_by)
```


## Theoretical model

Equation \ref{eq:lm} is a regression model with age, smoker (levels: yes, no, former) and their interaction as predictors (ANCOVA) formally expressed as

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    (\#eq:lm)
      y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot age_i + \beta_2 \cdot age_i^2 + \beta_3 \cdot smoker_i + \\
      \beta_4 \cdot age_i \cdot smoker_i + \beta_5 \cdot age_i^2 \cdot smoker_i + \epsilon_i
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
```

\noindent where $\epsilon$ is the residual error term that is assumed to be normally distributed around 0

$$
   \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2)
$$
\noindent with a standard deviation $\sigma^2$.


```{r}
# Contrast coding for categorical variable
contrasts(blomkvist$smoker) <- contr.helmert(3)
#contrasts(blomkvist$smoker) <- contr.sum(3)
colnames(contrasts(blomkvist$smoker)) <- c(", quit smoking", ", smoking")
```

## Model results

Fixed effects were added incrementally and evaluated using a Likelihood-ratio test. Here is a table in Table \ref{tab:lrt} showing the results of the likelihood-ratio test.

```{r}
# Regression models
model_0 <- lm(log(rt) ~ 1 + (1|id), data = blomkvist)
model_age <- lm(log(rt) ~ poly(age,1), data = blomkvist)
model_age2 <- lm(log(rt) ~ poly(age,2), data = blomkvist)
model_smoker <- lm(log(rt) ~ poly(age,2) + smoker, data = blomkvist)
model_interaction <- lm(log(rt) ~ poly(age,2) * smoker, data = blomkvist)
```

```{r eval = F}
anova_table <- apa_print(anova(model_interaction))$table
apa_table(anova_table, caption = 'Likelihood-ratio test')
```

```{r}
# Likelihood-ratio test
lrt <- anova(model_0, model_age, model_age2, model_smoker, model_interaction)
tidy_lrt <- tidy(lrt) 
```

```{r}
lrt_fin_model <- tidy_lrt %>% 
  filter(p.value < .05) %>%
  slice_tail(n = 1) %>% 
  mutate(across(statistic, round, 2)) %>% 
  transmute(term = paste0("$F(", df, ", ", res.df, ") = ", statistic, "$, ", "$p < .05$"))
```

The Likelihood-ratio test revealed that including age as quadratic predictor rendered a better fitting model compared to age as linear predictor `r lrt_fin_model`.

```{r}
# make summary look pretty
tidy_lrt_pretty <- tidy_lrt %>% 
  mutate(Model = c("M$_0$", "M$_{age}$", "M$_{age^2}$", "M$_{smoker}$", "M$_{interaction}$"),
         across(where(is.numeric), round, 2),
         across(p.value, ~case_when(. < 0.05 ~ "< .05", TRUE ~ str_remove(., "^0+"))),
         across(everything(), replace_na, "")) %>% 
  select(Model, 
         SumSq = sumsq, 
         RSS = rss,
         `$df$` = df, 
         `$df_{res}$` = res.df, 
         `\\textit{F}-statistic` = statistic, 
         `\\textit{p}-value` = p.value)
```

```{r lrt, results='asis'}
apa_table(tidy_lrt_pretty,
          escape = FALSE, 
          caption = 'Likelihood-ratio test',
          note = 'This is a note')
```

```{r modelcoefs}
# Summary of model coefficients
lmer_table <- apa_print(model_interaction)$table
apa_table(lmer_table, caption = "Model coefficients")
```

The overall model is significant; `r apa_print(model_interaction)$full_result$modelfit$r2`.^[Note, that this is just an example. This result is not surprising because the baseline is an intercept only model.] Slowdown in reaction times across age has a quadratic function; `r apa_print(model_interaction)$full_result$polyage__22`. The slowdown across age was more prominent for smokers compared to former smokers and non-smokers; 
`r apa_print(model_interaction)$full_result$polyage__22_smoker__smoking`.

```{r}
# Get marginal effects
effects <- effect("poly(age, 2):smoker", model_interaction) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>% 
  mutate(across(c(fit, lower, upper), exp)) 

```

Figure \ref{fig:smoker} shows marginal estimated development curves for the effect of smoking on reaction times in higher age. Towards the older ages, smokers shows longer reaction times but also a larger variability in reaction times compared to former smokers and non-smokers.

```{r smoker, fig.pos='ht', fig.height = 4, fig.width = 6, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = 'Marginal effects with distirbution of raw data in the margins.'}

ggplot(effects, aes(y = fit, 
                    x = age, 
                    colour = smoker, 
                    fill = smoker, 
                    linetype = smoker)) +
  geom_rug(data = blomkvist, 
           aes(y = rt), 
           alpha = .25) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper), 
              linetype = 0,
              alpha = .25) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_color_colorblind() +
  scale_fill_colorblind() +
  labs(colour = "Smoker", 
       fill = "Smoker", 
       linetype = "Smoker",
       y = "RT in msecs", 
       x = "Age")

```
