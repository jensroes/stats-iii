## Who are you?

> Say hi to everyone on your table and brainstorm ...

- Which statistical tests do you remember and when do you use them?
- Wouldn't it be nice to have one approach that can capture most (all?) of our data problems?

## Module Aims

- Provide a unified set of advanced statistical techniques that covers a wider range of data-analysis problems: multilevel generalised linear models
- General framework encapsulating a range of widely used techniques including linear regression, ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANCOVA, logistic regression, Poisson regression, log-linear, random effects / mixed-effects models etc. 
- These models arise as special cases of a single underlying general principle.
- Apply this general principle to a wider range of data analysis problems.


## Module Aims

- **Multilevel generalised linear models** will be introduce as sequence of consecutively more general models, all of which build on linear regression.
- **Linear regression**: review of multiple linear regression and factorial ANOVA. 
- **General linear models**: certain problems, which are poorly handled by ANOVA, can be easily accommodated (e.g. varying slope models).
- **Generalised linear models**: transformations applied to linear models allows modelling of data-types including categorical, ordinal, discrete frequency data.
- **Multi-level models**: data with inherently hierarchical structure, which have often been inadequately dealt with.


## Learning outcomes

<!-- > By the end of this module you should be able to: -->

<!-- 1. Critically discuss the theoretical basis of a wide variety of statistical tests that are in common practice. -->
<!-- 2. Critically evaluate debates on the relative merits or appropriateness of different statistical methods being used in psychology. -->
<!-- 3. Critically consider the formal or mathematical basis of statistical models and the mathematical basis of statistical inference. -->
<!-- 4. Critically evaluate the choices of statistical tools available for any given research problem -->


<!-- ## Skills, Qualities, and Attributes -->

> By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. Apply advanced statistics to real-world data-analysis problems.
2. Use rational and principled arguments to justify the choice of statistical methods.
3. Engage in peer-to-peer debate about methods and practices of data-analysis.
4. Demonstrate a range of transferable skills, including data-analysis, data-preparation, computer programming, graphical presentation of quantitative evidence, reporting of data-analysis results.


## Why was it a good idea to choose this module?

>- Why did you choose *Statistics III*?
>- What do you expect to get out off this module?
>- How confident do you feel about RStudio; how about stats?
>- Is there anything you're worried about with this module?



## Why was it a good idea to choose this module?

- Career opportunities! Stats and statistical software skills transfer to many different areas in academia and industry.
- You will be able to show-off your data analysis skill in your final year project, unless you are using qualitative methods.
- Solid understanding of statistical methods is relevant for planning data collections and making sense of quantitative data.
- Data analysis can be efficient, flexible, reliable, and fast once you have had enough R practice.
- You have the opportunity to improve your data analysis and R skills with three experts.

```{r echo = F}
readODS::read_ods("schedule.ods") %>% 
  select(-Workshop) %>% 
  mutate(across(Topic, ~str_remove(., "\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)")),
         across(everything(), ~replace_na(., "")),
         across(Lecturer, ~str_replace_all(., "Mark", "Mark Andrews")),
         across(Lecturer, ~str_replace_all(., "Thom", "Thom Baguley")),

  kable_styling(full_width = T, bootstrap_options = c("responsive", "hover", "striped"))
```


## Engaging with this module 

>- 1 $\times$ 4-hours workshop each week. 
>- Mixture of theory and practical exercises.
>- Together, we will work through statistics problems using R. 
>- For each topic, there will be detail accompanying lecture notes.
>- To engage successfully with this module, attend all workshops, and read the lecture notes.
>- For *excellent* results, you will need to demonstrate independent learning that goes beyond what we cover in class.


## Assessment

> **Using data-sets of your own choice, perform and report analyses using the tools in 1 -- 4 to address a set of theoretical questions to address a research question of relevance to psychology.**

1. Logistic regression for binomial data
2. Regression models for count data
3. Multilevel regression models
4. A new methods that was not explicitly covered in class


## Assessment


*Psychological relevance*: address some non-trivial question of some psychological relevance using your chosen data. 

>- Very wide range of topics and sub-fields, many of which overlap with many other disciplines. 
>- Consider the data-set described [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/AER/ResumeNames.html) published in

Bertrand, M. and Mullainathan, S. (2004). Are Emily and Greg More Employable Than Lakisha and Jamal? A Field Experiment on Labor Market Discrimination. *American Economic Review*, 94, 991â€“1013.

>- Published in an economics journal but it addresses implicit racial bias, and is obviously related to psychology. 


## Assessment

>- Choose a different data set per each question.
>- 4 separate data analyses reported on no more than 4 pages each.
>- For all questions, provide full technical details, and graphical analysis.
>- Theoretical model (assumed data-generative process) needs to be motivated.



## Assessment

- Deadline for submission via Dropbox: **Jan 13th 2025** 
- Individual written feedback (by Feb 3rd 2025) to help you how to best carry out and report statistical analyses.
- We are looking for evidence of 
  - understanding and knowledge of the theoretical basis.
  - how and why to apply certain statistical models.
  - practical skills in data manipulation and analysis. 
- For high or exceptional grades, display learning that goes beyond the content explicitly taught in class. 
- See [Grading Matrix](https://now.ntu.ac.uk/d2l/le/content/1038633/viewContent/13153112/View) on NOW for details.
