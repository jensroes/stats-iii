## Who are you?

> Say hi to everyone on your table and discuss ...

>- Which statistical tests do you know?
>- What do you know about when do you use them?

## Module Aims

- Provide a unified set of advanced statistical techniques that can cover an exceptionally wider range of data-analysis problems; aka multilevel generalised linear models
- General data-analytical framework encapsulating a range of widely used techniques including linear regression, ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANCOVA, logistic regression, Poisson regression, log-linear analysis, random effects / mixed-effects models etc. 
- Describe how these models arise as special cases of a single underlying general principle.
- Demonstrate how we can apply this general principle to a wider range of data analysis problems.


## Module Aims

- **Multilevel generalized linear models** will be introduce as sequence of consecutively more general models, all of which build on the familiar principle of linear regression.
- **Linear regression**: review of multiple linear regression and factorial ANOVA. 
- **General linear models**: certain problems, which are poorly handled by standard ANOVA, can be easily accommodated (e.g. varying slope models).
- **Generalized linear models**: transformations can be applied to linear models to apply them to data-types including categorical, ordinal, discrete frequency data.
- **Multi-level models**: data with inherently hierarchical structure, yet have often been inadequately dealt with in data analysis.


## Learning outcomes

> By the end of this module you should be able to:

1. Critically discuss the theoretical basis of a wide variety of statistical tests that are in common practice.
2. Critically evaluate debates on the relative merits or appropriateness of different statistical methods being used in psychology.
3. Critically consider the formal or mathematical basis of statistical models and the mathematical basis of statistical inference.
4. Critically evaluate the choices of statistical tools available for any given research problem


## Skills, Qualities, and Attributes

> By the end of this module, you should be able to:

1. Apply advanced statistics to real-world data-analysis problems, whether academic or non-academic.
2. Use rational and principled arguments to justify the choice of statistical methods.
3. Engage in peer-to-peer debate about methods and practices of data-analysis.
4. Demonstrate a range of transferable skills, including data-analysis, data-preparation, computer programming, graphical presentation of quantitative evidence, reporting of data-analysis results.


## Why was it a good idea to choose this module?

>- Why did you choose *Statistics III*?
>- What do you expect to learn or to get out off this module?
>- How confident do you feel about RStudio; how about stats?
>- Is there anything you're worried about with this module?



## Why was it a good idea to choose this module?

- Career opportunities! Stats and statistical software skills transfer to many different areas in academia and industry.
- Unless you use qualitative methods, you will be able to show-off your data analysis skill in your final year project.
- Solid understanding of statistical methods is relevant for making sense of quantitative data.
- Data analysis can be efficient, flexible, reliable, and fast once you have had enough R practice.
- You have the opportunity to improve your data analysis and R skills with three experts.


## Outline {.smaller}

```{r echo = F}
readODS::read_ods("schedule.ods") %>% 
  select(-Workshop) %>% 
  mutate(across(Topic, ~str_remove(., "\\s*\\([^\\)]+\\)")),
         across(everything(), ~replace_na(., "")),
         across(Lecturer, ~str_replace_all(., "Mark", "Mark Andrews")),
         across(Lecturer, ~str_replace_all(., "Thom", "Thom Baguley")),
         across(Lecturer, ~str_replace_all(., "Jens", "Jens Roeser"))) %>% 
  select(`W/C` = Dates, Topic, Lecturer) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Each week of Term 1, except PACE week. Each week two 2-hour workshops.") %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = T, bootstrap_options = c("responsive", "hover", "striped"))
```


## Engaging with this module 

>- 2 workshops each week. 
>- Mixture of theory and practical exercises.
>- Together, we will work through statistics problems using R. 
>- For each topic, there will be detail accompanying lecture notes.
>- To engage successfully with this module, you should attend each workshop each week, and read the lecture notes for each topic.
>- For *excellent* results, you will also need to demonstrate independent learning that goes beyond what we cover in class.


## Assessment

> **Using data-sets of your own choice, perform and report analyses using the tools in 1 -- 4 to address a set of theoretical questions of your choice that relate to your chosen data-sets.**

1. Binary logistic regression
2. Regression models for count data
3. Multilevel linear regression models
4. A new topic / methods that was not explicitly covered in class


## Assessment

>- Choose a different data set per each question.
>- 4 separate data analyses reported on no more than 4 pages each
>- For all questions, provide full technical details, and graphical analysis.
>- Theoretical model (assumed process that generates the outcome variable) needs to be motivated.
>- By *theoretical question*, we mean some non-trivial question. 

> E.g. if your data set concerns rates of extra-marital affairs and properties of people who do and do not have affairs, a theoretical question could simply be what variables (such as age, gender, religiousness, etc) explain why people have affairs and how often they do so.


## Assessment

- Deadline for submission via Dropbox: **Jan 8th 2024**
- Individual written feedback
- Feedback will help you how to best carry out and report the types of statistical analyses that are at the core of this course.
- We wish to see evidence of 
  - understanding and knowledge of the theoretical basis.
  - how and why to apply certain statistical models.
  - practical skills in data manipulation and analysis. 
- For high or exceptional grades it is vital that you display learning that goes beyond the content explicitly taught in class. 
- See [Grading Matrix](https://now.ntu.ac.uk/d2l/le/content/961441/viewContent/12100887/View) on NOW for details.

## Assessment 

- Work must be submitted as *single* zip archive with 
  - One RMarkdown file
  - PDF document generated from RMarkdown
  - RStudio project file
  - Data and supplementary files (e.g. bibliography, custom R function)
  - for an example of how to use different features of RMarkdown see Demo answer on NOW
- Work must be reproducible as per requirement of the assignment using RMarkdown file.
- Your work, analysis, plots, descriptions, for each question will be contained in the RMarkdown file, and this will reference all relevant data files.


## Assessment 

- For all questions choose a different data set that is appropriate to the task. 
- Where do I find data: 
  - Many more recent publications release their data
  - Journals such as [Journal of Open Psychology Data](https://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/), [Nature: Scientific data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/), [Bahavior Research Methods](https://www.springer.com/journal/13428), [PLOS](https://plos.org/open-science/open-data/), [Psychonomic Bulletin & Review](https://www.springer.com/journal/13423?gclid=CjwKCAjwsKqoBhBPEiwALrrqiL8B1Z2FsdJl_yJq2CJaj1_bm4QuFOHx6Pjjs_SixnEA-QgAdiPemxoCnW4QAvD_BwE)

- Only restriction: you must share the data with us, so no confidential data.


## Assessment 

> For all tasks, provide ...

- descriptive statistics and graphical visualizations of the data.
- full details of the statistical model that you are using.
- full statistical details of the inferred model parameters.
- analysis, including graphical analysis, of the predictions of the model.
- full statistical details of model fit and comparisons with alternative models.

## Assessment

- Use them in at least some of the analyses.
- For high or exceptional grades, display learning that goes beyond the content explicitly taught in class.



## Question 4: A new topic 

>- Y3 modules require you to go beyond the class contents for high grades.
- Talk to your supervisor / us re analyses relevant for your project.
- 6 months free access to [DataCamp](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses) (until March 20, 2024).

## Formative assessment 

>- Practice how to write a report of the kind we expect.
- Data analysis report on linear regression (first lecture topic).
- Support in workshop **Oct 10 2023**.
- Submit via Dropbox until **Oct 27 2023**
- We will provide feedback on what you did well and what you can improve.
- It does not (directly) affect your grade.


## Formative assessment 

>- Follow the same procedure as for the final assessment (discussed before).
- Submit your work as a single zip archive.
- Just one data analysis hence 4 pages max.
- Data set of your own choice; report a **linear regression** analysis to address a theoretical question of your own choice.

## Task: In your groups ...

>- Discuss the assessment brief: how do you feel about this particular assessment format?
>- Is there anything that you don't find clear?
>- What concerns have you got with the task?
>- What opportunities do you see? Have you got ideas you want to share?


## Support 

- [Discussion forum](https://ntur.ntupsychology.net/) for R, stats, assessment-related questions, and useful resources.
- Because answer should be of interest to everyone, better place to write maths, share code, tagging.
- Also you will receive an answer faster.
- We might refer emails to the forum so everyone can benefit from our answer.
- Do help each other!
- Obviously lecturers like seeing engagement with their module :)
- Online support will stop at **Dec 15 2023**.
- **Email** us for questions that are less general; for sensitive information contact the ML Mark Andrews: `mark.andrews@ntu.ac.uk`
